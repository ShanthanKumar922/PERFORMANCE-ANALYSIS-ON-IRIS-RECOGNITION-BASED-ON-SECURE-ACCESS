## Performance Analysis on iris Recognition based on Secure Access
Small description about the project like one below
The performance analysis of the iris recognition based on secure access is using Machine Learning and giving accurate output of the iris pattern and improving the overall user experience.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Iris recognition refers to the automated process of recognizing individuals based on their iris patterns. Iris recognition algorithms have demonstrated very low false match rates and very high matching efficiency in large databases. This is not entirely suprising given the (a)complex textrual pattern of the iris stroma that varies significantly across individuals, (b)The perceived permanence of its distinguishing attributes, and (c) its limited genetic penetrance.

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- Significant investment needed in biometrics for security.
- Machinie learning and algorithms must be very advanced to minimize biometric demographic bias.
- Biometric databases can still be hacked.
- High scalability.
- Less time complexity.
- Manaully checking process.

## Requirements
<!--List the requirements of the project as shown below-->
* Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
* Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the sign language detection system.
* Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV is essential for efficient image processing and real-time hand gesture recognition.
* Version Control: Implementation of Git for collaborative development and effective code management.
* IDE: Use of VSCode as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and version control integration.
* Additional Dependencies: Includes Matlab, OpenCV, and embeded c, and proteus design.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
It is clear the iris texture in iris recognition has no consistent shapes, edges, or semantic structure unlike in classical object detection and classification task.

This project serves as a foundation for future developments in assistive technologies and contributes to creating a more inclusive and accessible digital environment.
